POST-CONTEST EDIT: This is an exact duplicate of the original entry,
but I have removed the converted images from the source to decrease
size and included links to an archived Github repo and the original
post now that they both no longer need updating. I also added an
animated PNG of the gameplay as a preview.

Wow, look at that title box! That's a pretty good box if I do say
so myself! And with ASCII too, I'm impressed by my latent art skillz.

Anyway, this is Food Fighter; my Cemetech Contest 25 entry. It's my
first contest contribution (and most likely my last until summer) and
I've had a blast making it. The original rumor was that the contest
theme would be cooking, but Epsilon revealed it to be heat later on.
Thankfully, my devious plan to squish Food Fighter into the theme
was actually super easy, since I had plenty of flamin' hot mechanics
already. Now then, here's the controls:

Arrow Keys: Move up, down, left, and right. Also changes direction for
            flamethrowing and confirms entering or leaving the
            kitchen.
[2nd]:	    Fire flamethrower, interact with objects, and lock
            direction.
[del]:      Pause/unpause the game.
[clear]:    Exit game

HOW TO PLAY:
- You start in Jerry's apartment, it's just a cozy rest zone where you
can press buttons
- Go through the doorway to go to the kitchen, use the arrow keys to
confirm entry or wait a little longer.
- The timer counts down for 2 minutes, during that time enemies will
spawn. Kill them all with fire!
- Don't let the temperature gauge go into the red or you will
experience side-effects such as "kaboom" and the Big Kill.
- You can pick up an ingredient and then have to deposit it in its
slot with [2nd] after running up to it. Doing so will not activate
strafing mode, so you can spin around to attack quickly.
- Meat and cheese ingredients give 2 points since the corners are
tricky to handle get in and out of without getting swarmed.
- After the 2 minute countdown is up and all enemies and ingredients
are cleared, you get your health refilled by one and the countdown
restarts.
- Keep going for as long as you can, or go out the blue doors to go
back home.

NOTE: NO C/ASM PROGRAMS WILL RUN ON OS 5.5 AND HIGHER! DO NOT UPGRADE!
If you have upgraded, visit Cemetech or TI-Planet and search for
topics about downgrading, as the tools may change soon or hopefully
become unnecessary in the future

Sending to the calculator:
1. Pick up your calculator, stare at it to assert dominance.

2. Download TI-Connect CE if you haven't already.

3. Download the latest C library files: https://tiny.cc/clibs, I
include them with the program but there may be newer ones.

4. Grasp your calc firmly and plug it into the PC you have the game
and Connect software on.

5. Drag FOODFITE.8xp and the C libs onto your calc listed in TI-
Connect.

6. Make sure it sends to the archive or it will be erased if your calc
resets or runs out of batteries.

6. Press [prgm], scroll to FOODFITE, and press enter.

7. Show it to some middles-choolers and blow their tiny minds for your
entertainment.

If you have the source code:
My excuse is *Roblox oof noise* and "I'm like YandereDev but better in
a worse way!"

Tips 'n tricks for the weak:
- Strafing is annoying at first, but it's extremely useful when you're
getting swarmed.
- You can run slightly faster than the slamwhiches, so try to out-
manuever them if they gather in large groups.
- You cannot play as Barack Obama in this game.
- Enemies have a one-second delay before they can move or hurt you, so
be swift and merciless. They may be defencless, but they'll still try
to kill you later.

Thanks for downloading my trash! I hope you mildly enjoy it and FINISH
YOUR HOMEWORK FIRST before playing! Remember to check Cemetech for
other cool stuff, and maybe learn to make your own games too! We need
more members for our train cult so we can plunge the world into
eternal Wednesday and hold Have Calc Will Program sermons every day!
